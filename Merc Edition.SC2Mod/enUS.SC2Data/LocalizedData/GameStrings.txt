Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_07E491EB=Not much to be made here sadly...although with the Zerg infesting the civilian settlements we could technically let them become infested and then purge them so we can sell the scraps to make a profit. If we do this the infested attacks will ramp up on our base significantly so be prepared.  Just don't take too long to take action sir, the Protoss are still hanging around and I have no idea just how charitable they are willing to be.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_127D95BD=Dominion contractors have decided to retake the planet and require us to sanitize the two Command Centers in this area.  Position four of our Skibis Angels near each Command Center to begin the sanitization. Once sanitized you may use them as forward bases until the mission is complete.  Also, surviving Colonists report flying queens in the A.O so be careful at night if you plan to go out past the defenses.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_17EC5578=Mar Sara rebels have informed us of an old Confederate Starport in the area that we can use to leave sooner. Unfortunately for us we do not know its exact position, we will have to rescue the rebels in order to find its exact location. 
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_1CB39EC9=Mengsk has statues and billboards littered everywhere in this town, the local marshal thinks they are an eyesore and will pay for each one we destroy.  Leave none standing.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_21BADA4C=Ever play the game the floor is lava as a child? Well this is the grown up version of that but with Zerg thrown in just to make our lives that much more interesting. Tychus was more than happy to call in a favor or two with his contacts since he didn't want to do this with people who have no experience.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_25C3C5EB=The pay days just keep coming with these Tosh contracts, Terrazine is an extremely rare resource both on and off the black market for drug dealers however we are not after the Terrazine.  The Protoss will try and stop us by locking down those sites, if we let them lockdown six we will be able to sell off the research data for a nice boost of credits.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_28C51485=It has been so long since I was here, many bad memories of our stand against the Zerg.  If my memory is correct James Raynor's old base is located to the east, if I can make it there quickly enough may be able to take control of what is left to aid me in whatever is giving off these strong psionic waves near the Zerg bases.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_31446809=Good and Bad news, the good news is that we can repair that comm channel that Tychus is stuck on and we can regain control of the Odin.  The Bad news is that it's going to cost us a pretty penny for the service. I managed to talk the repair service into taking Minerals as payment but it's not cheap.  However if we let Tychus do his thing we can use that service for something else....like say take over a Loki that's near the third base and then sell it off after the mission if it survives.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_5DAFE497=The Terran Oceanic Research Group, T.O.R.G for short, has requested our services to eliminate the Zerg threat in this vicinity so that they may continue their research in peace.  If we are able to, they will wire us a considerable amount of credits for our trouble.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_6D5A7B80=Init...Merc Edition Upgrade
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_6FD51BF1=Strange, I'm picking up a few old Terran buildings on the outskirts of my scans in this area. Perhaps if I can find them I will be able to salvage some knowledge from them and share what I know with James Raynor.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_7141E8B8=Farms to the east where we entered have piqued the interest of an off world cattle baron, keep the farms intact until we leave and he will pay us for our trouble.  Oh and don't worry too much about those civilians if they aren't paying just leave them be for now. Of course if the Zerg are simply taken out then I suppose we wouldn't have to worry about anything, would we sir?
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_7175B180=I hear them calling, voices from my visions, the lost Legion commanders are somewhere in this area.  I should look for them as I continue with my main mission of finding the shrines.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_8B3D9D37=The fly boys will be extra happy after we finish this job, so much so that the Dominion will graciously give us access to their more advanced drop pods after it is done.  Lotta good it does us now so late in this game of life but thems the brakes I suppose...now let's cut the brake lines and make this more interesting.  Warfield wants to blow up the station, I say let's save it.  We do what we had to do on Meinhoff and sanitize the whole thing, bring four Skibis Angels to each cooling tower and defend them until they clear it. If we can clean this platform I think we can have a staging area for Warfields Gorgons in the upcoming battle.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_A54710E3=One thing I hate more than green beans is a merc who doesn't stay true to their original contract.  So with that I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that I found a hidden program within our mineral counter that once you reach the set amount needed to pay off Mira she will also take some credits that we use to purchase upgrades for our forces.  The good news is not that great but still we can put an end to what Mira has planned.  I have managed to increase the amount of minerals needed to pay off Mira for her aid in dealing with Orlan, by doing this if we can take out Orlans base before we reach the amount needed to pay off Mira. I can backdoor her finances and steal a large portion of her own credits when we are finished.  Oh and this was all Matt's idea.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_B43DDBEC=Russian roulette with a sun about to go supernova should be above our paygrade but on the bright side, pun intended, that fire wave won't reach us for a while and we will only have to deal with severe weather anomalies for the time being so lets make this quick before we all get blown to hell.  
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_C69916B1=Init...Unit Replace
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_C74680EB=The final stand, it is a great loss that the Terran's fell before they could join our final stand.  If we had their defenses we could hold out for much longer and maybe even stop this assault.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_D1EDBD39=As you can see Mr. Hill has sent a favor our way and got us in contact with some Protoss known as the Zhakul Guardians.  These guys mean serious business and have a bit of a bone to pick with whatever is on this station.  If they can save any Protoss on this place they will.  Just make sure they don't blow up all of it, we need to make a profit on something.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_D2BA4636=Lava planets are the worst, the same can be said for people who think a frontal assault on an enemy who has the advantage is a good idea.  If we can clear out one of the bases, North or South, that should provide a large enough landing area for reinforcements to see and land relatively safely.  Who knows they may even pay us to send them the prime landing coordinates.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_D6B76FD5=The Mar Sara rebels have a stronghold to the west of our position and are under constant attack from the Dominion base.  Hold off on rescuing them until they agree to pay us for our aid.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_D8119886=First a supernova sun and now an ancient spacecraft that has rip field generators that can kill anything unshielded at a molecular level.  I'm starting to doubt your choices of missions sir.  However we can still earn a rather sizable payday, if we can keep those rip field generators online we can scrap them after and make a huge payday.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_DAFDAB1B=Hear me out on this sir, let Tychus actually parade the Odin around the city.  Stetmann has set up a sort or wireless transmitter that siphons off the credits of the bases that the parade goes by, this will give us a large influx of money but at the cost of the Dominion will have all three bases up at running after the parade.  But hey at least we will be just a little bit richer, not to mention our own base should be set up at that time as well.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_E07FBC4A=The Moebius group has decided to cut the contracts of several freelancers in the area.  If we are able to rescue them all they will show how thankful they are with credits.  Also a bounty has been placed on the Queen of Blades by the Tyrador Militia, if we are able to subdue her at least once the payout will be more than substantial.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_E10E7623=Hard to make a payday from this operation but thankfully the scans were able to pick up a faint signal from somewhere near the first cell block.  I'm not sure what it could be but if it can give us some extra credits then I'm sure the crew will be all for it.  No sense in doing a favor for a friend and not finding a way to get a bit extra.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_E21786FD=As sketchy as this Tosh is this could be a big pay day for us, those rich minerals can sell for a rather nice price to those who run barter town.  Tosh wants 8k in minerals and the rest can go to lining our pockets.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_E8245A9A=Now this brings back memories from childhood, watching those old movies with the bandits robbing the trains and making their escape on horseback.  All that aside my contact has informed us of another train running on the lower tracks hauling some serious loot.  If we can stop that 3:10 train we can make one hell of a payday, and be quick about it, it only passes by this location a few times before it goes back to the yard.<n/>
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_EA0B8EF6=The guys really don't like this situation one bit but I was able to find a way to turn it around for us.  A few of the fleeing colonists mentioned that they left a couple large stashes of mining equipment in the area that they were going to use to mine a nearby gold deposit.  We should requisition the mining equipment and find that mine so we can turn an actual profit.  The colonists will pay us a decent amount to aid them in leaving but after that they are on their own.  If we can at least help the ones that are not infected I say let the Protoss purge the rest and just maybe we can play both sides and come out with a massive pay day.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_ECC6F2CE=Working for the Dominion is not the best of ideas, especially when it's a Dominion ghost. But hey as long as she pays I'm sure we can come to an understanding, however nothing is stopping you from taking the money and helping out Tosh.  Maybe a long con is in order, just sayin.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_FA6B9BAB=Sir I was looking over the scans for the temple and noticed that it is made of an extremely rare alloy that can't be found anywhere else in Terran space.  This got me thinking, if we were to not use the laser to demolish the temple doors and instead use good old fashioned precision cutters we could salvage those doors and sell them to make a large pay day.  Also just a friendly reminder to try not to use too much fuel on the laser, we can sell the fuel on the market as well for a nice chunk of change.  I managed to install a switch to turn the laser on or off at your leisure to help if you decide to clear the area, also one last thing.  Those smaller temples look to be more brittle than the main one so a few well placed explosives should open them up nice and easy for you.
