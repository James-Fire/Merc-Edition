Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_092773E4=It has been so long since I was here. Many bad memories of our stand against the Zerg.  If my memory is correct, James Raynor's old base is located to the east. If I can make it there quickly enough, there may be something to take control of to aid me in whatever is giving off these strong psionic waves near the Zerg bases.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_0D774CD5=The crew is none too pleased with our current predicament, but I've devised a plan to flip the script. A few of the escaping colonists revealed they abandoned significant caches of mining gear intended for a nearby gold deposit. We need to seize that equipment and locate the mine to secure a real profit.<n/><n/>The colonists are willing to compensate us handsomely for assisting their escape, but once they're gone, they're on their own. If we can assist those who aren't infected, I suggest we let the Protoss handle the rest and let that Mothership purge everything. This way, we might just play both sides and walk away with a hefty payday. Just make sure to move our base somewhere else so we don't get hit with that planet cracker weapon.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_1AE0B94B=Unfortunately, there's not much profit to be had here. However, with the Zerg overrunning the civilian areas, we could allow them to become infested and then eliminate the threat, selling off the remains for a profit. Be warned, though: this will likely escalate the infested assaults on our base, so readiness is key.<n/><n/>Time is of the essence, sir. The Protoss are still lurking nearby, and their intentions remain uncertain. We need to act swiftly before they decide to intervene.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_282AB58B=The Moebius group has made the decision to terminate the contracts of multiple freelancers in the region. Should we manage to save them, their gratitude will be expressed through credits. Additionally, the Tyrador Militia has issued a bounty on the Queen of Blades; subduing her even once will yield a significant reward.<n/><n/>This situation presents a dual opportunity: not only can we assist those freelancers in need, but we also have the chance to earn a considerable payout by taking down a formidable adversary. The stakes are high, and the potential rewards could be game-changing for us.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_3AF424A3=This stirs up nostalgic echoes from my youth, reminiscing about those classic films featuring bandits hijacking trains and fleeing on horseback. Setting those memories aside, my informant has tipped us off about another train on the lower tracks, carrying a substantial haul. If we can intercept that 3:10 train, we stand to score a significant payday, but we need to act swiftly; it only rolls through this spot a handful of times before it heads back to the yard.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_43C4D1C9=Mr. Hill has done us a solid by connecting us with the Zhakul Guardians, a formidable group of Protoss. These warriors are not to be trifled with, and they have a vested interest in dealing with whatever threats lurk on this station. Their mission is clear: to rescue any Protoss they can find here. However, we need to tread carefully; their methods can be explosive, and we can't afford to lose everything in the process. Our goal is to salvage something from this situation and turn a profit, so let's keep a close eye on their actions.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_49433A65=Lava planets are the worst. Tthe same can be said for people who think a frontal assault on an enemy who has the advantage is a good idea.  If we can clear out one of the bases, North or South, that should provide a large enough landing area for reinforcements to see and land relatively safely.  Who knows, they may even pay us to send them the prime landing coordinates.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_55CC250B=Listen closely, sir. I propose we let Tychus showcase the Odin throughout the city. Stetmann has devised a wireless transmitter that will extract credits from the bases along the parade route. This operation could yield a significant financial boost for us, although it comes with the downside of the Dominion having all three bases operational again once the parade concludes. Still, we'll be a bit wealthier for our efforts, and by that time, our own base should be fully operational as well. 
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_5A4E5173=A supernova sun followed by an ancient spacecraft equipped with rip field generators capable of annihilating anything unprotected at a molecular level--I'm beginning to question your mission selections, sir. Yet, there's still a lucrative opportunity on the horizon; if we can maintain those rip field generators in operational condition, we could dismantle them later for a significant profit, provided you don't obliterate them in the process.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_7739C6CF=The fly boys will be extra happy after we finish this job, so much so that the Dominion will graciously give us access to their more advanced drop pods after it's done. Lotta good it does us now so late in this, but thems the breaks I suppose... now let's cut the brake lines and make this more interesting.  Warfield wants to blow up the station, I say let's save it.  We do what we had to do on Meinhoff and sanitize the whole thing, bring four Skibis Angels to each cooling tower and defend them until they clear it. If we can clean this platform I think we can have a staging area for Warfield's Gorgons in the upcoming battle.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_78065552=I reviewed the scans of the temple and discovered it's constructed from a rare alloy unique to this region of space. This raises a profitable opportunity: instead of using the laser to break down the temple doors, we could employ precision cutters to salvage them. This approach could yield a significant payday if we sell the doors afterward.<n/><n/>Additionally, be mindful of fuel consumption with the laser; we definitely have enough to open the door, but I'm unsure how much extra Moebius brought. Also, we can profit from selling excess fuel on the market. I've installed a switch for you to control the laser as needed. Lastly, the smaller temples appear more fragile than the main structure, so a few strategically placed explosives should effectively open them up. 
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_7E66DF80=Mar Sara rebels have informed us of an old Confederate Starport in the area that we can use to leave sooner. Unfortunately for us we do not know its exact position, so we're gonna have to rescue the rebels in order to find its exact location.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_8D8AC7C4=Working for the Dominion is not the best of ideas, especially when it's a Dominion ghost. But hey as long as she pays I'm sure we can come to an understanding. However, nothing is stopping you from taking the money and helping out Tosh. Maybe a long con is in order, just sayin.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_8E1FE6F6=Hard to make a payday from this operation, but thankfully the scans were able to pick up a faint signal from somewhere near the first cell block. I'm not sure what it could be, but if it can give us some extra credits then I'm sure the crew will be all for it. No sense in doing a favor for a friend and not finding a way to get a bit extra.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_96C22D7E=As sketchy as this Tosh guy is, this could be a big pay day for us. Those rich minerals can sell for a rather nice price to those who run barter town.  Tosh wants 8k in minerals and the rest can go to lining our pockets.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_9944095B=The final stand, it is a great loss that the Terrans fell before they could join our final stand. If we had their defenses we could hold out for much longer and maybe even stop this assault.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_A1E81C99=<c val="0000FF">+
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_AD91334D=The pay days just keep coming with these Tosh contracts. Terrazine is an extremely rare resource both on and off the black market for drug dealers. However, we are not after the Terrazine.  The Protoss will try and stop us by locking down those sites, but if we let them lockdown six we will be able to sell off the research data for far more than the terrazine.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_AFDC2748=There's nothing I despise more than a mercenary who betrays their contract. Now, let's get to the point: I've got some news, both good and bad. The bad news is that I've uncovered a hidden feature in our mineral counter. Once we accumulate the required minerals to settle our debt with Mira, she'll siphon off some of our credits intended for upgrading our forces. The good news, while not exactly a silver lining, is that we can thwart Mira's schemes. I've managed to adjust the mineral threshold needed to pay her off, which means if we can eliminate Orlan's base before we hit that target, I can exploit a loophole in her finances and pilfer a significant chunk of her credits once the dust settles. And just so you know, this brilliant plan was all Matt's doing. 
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_BB341F98=The Mar Sara rebels are under heavy fire from the Dominion, and their desperation for help is evident. However, any aid we offer must come with a price. Until we secure a formal agreement, we must stay out of the fray. Keep a watchful eye on developments, but hold back on deploying any resources without a contract in place.<n/><n/>We've also picked up strange signals from the north, hinting at either a new danger or a potential advantage. While it's not critical to probe these readings immediately, doing so could yield valuable intelligence. Proceed with caution; the situation warrants attention, but prioritize our strategic interests. 
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_BEDC0312=The farms to the east have attracted the attention of an off-world cattle baron by the name of Silas Montgomery Burns. Maintain their integrity until our departure, and he will compensate us for our efforts. Civilians are not a concern unless they opt to purchase our protection services. <n/><n/>By eliminating the Zerg bases in this region, we can significantly reduce our stay, ensuring the farms' security and facilitating the safe evacuation of civilians off the planet. However please be sure that the civilians are paying first before you send our guys into the meat grinder.

Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_D70B22B6=Dominion contractors are gearing up to reclaim the planet and need us to cleanse the two Command Centers in the vicinity. Deploy four of our Skibis Angels at each Command Center to initiate the sanitization process. After the area is secured, these locations can serve as forward bases until the operation concludes.<n/><n/>Additionally, surviving Colonists have reported sightings of flying queens in the area of operations, so exercise caution if you intend to venture out after dark beyond the defenses. Stay alert and ready for anything.
Param/Value/lib_BA5CCDED_D79C03A6=Strange, I'm picking up a few old Terran buildings on the outskirts of my scans in this area. Perhaps if I can find them I will be able to salvage some knowledge from them and share what I know with James Raynor.

Successful completion of this task will result in a significant credit transfer to our accounts.<n/><n/>However, we must remain vigilant; taking down the Zerg could provoke a more coordinated response from the Protoss. This potential backlash requires careful consideration before we engage.
